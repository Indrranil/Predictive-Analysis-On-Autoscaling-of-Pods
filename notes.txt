                        model -> successsfull evluating
                            
                            model -> successfully predicting 



    Pending tasks -> 1. Create a cluter with a deployment 
                     2. in `predict_and_update.py` enter the correcet path for the deployment.yaml
                     3. Test -> check if the script updates the deployment.yaml-> replicas, check if it is set to the predicted {num_replicas}






    Model -> python/bash script -> Updates the Deployment.yaml
